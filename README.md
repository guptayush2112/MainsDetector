NOTE: This is a simualtion based Electronics Project used to immitate a real world hardware implementation of the same.

As the name suggests, this circuit detects if there is voltage flow or not through the mains wire without any contact with it. 

INSTRUCTIONS to view the project correctly:
1) Download the Github Repository as a .zip file and open the Mains Detector.asc using LTspice Software[Download Link--> https://ltspice.analog.com/software/LTspiceXVII.exe

2) After opening--

a. The circuit can be seen along with clear details and components.

b. You can directly see the circuit simulation in the Simulation Results.jpg file that I have added.
OR
b. If you want to simulate it yourself, follow the instructions_MustRead.txt file for successful simulations.

3) For your reference and as a screenshot proof that the circuit is correct & working, I have added the Simulation Results.jpg screenshot to show the required successful simualations.
