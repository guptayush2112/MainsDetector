NOTE: This is a simualtion based Electronics Project, used to immitate a real world hardware implementation of the same digitally.
When electricity is not properly handled, it results in electrical shocks with a nasty experience; which is why safety must come first when working with electricity or electrical devices. 

In order to avoid injury, prior to starting work on an electrical box such as an AC mains switch-board or a power supply, one must first verify there is no AC voltage. It is really hard to completely isolate a device from the main supply; so, how can one be sure that there's no voltage remaining? This is where the Mains Detector comes into play.
Usually, we use the voltage tester to detect if there is any voltage flowing through a live wire. But a situation may occur when you cannot test the live wire voltage using normal tester cause, there may be danger near live wire or maybe you cannot reach at that point to measure the voltage because of wired voltage tester. So, for such situations we can use a Mains Voltage Detector.

As the name suggests, this circuit detects if there is voltage flow or not through the mains wire without any contact with it. 

INSTRUCTIONS to view the project correctly:
1) Download the Github Repository as a .zip file and open the Mains Detector.asc using LTspice Software[Download Link--> https://ltspice.analog.com/software/LTspiceXVII.exe

2) After opening--

a. The circuit can be seen along with clear details and components.

b. You can directly see the circuit simulation in the Simulation Results.jpg file that I have added.
OR
b. If you want to simulate it yourself, follow the instructions_MustRead.txt file for successful simulations.

3) For your reference and as a screenshot proof that the circuit is correct & working, I have added the Simulation Results.jpg screenshot to show the required successful simualations.
