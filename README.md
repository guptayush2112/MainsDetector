When electricity is not properly handled, it results in electrical shocks with a nasty experience; which is why safety must come first when working with electricity or electrical devices. 

In order to avoid injury, prior to starting work on an electrical box such as an AC mains switch-board or a power supply, one must first verify there is no AC voltage. It is really hard to completely isolate a device from the main supply; so, how can one be sure that there's no voltage remaining? This is where the Mains Detector comes into play.
Usually, we use the voltage tester to detect if there is any voltage flowing through a live wire. But a situation may occur when you cannot test the live wire voltage using normal tester cause, there may be danger near live wire or maybe you cannot reach at that point to measure the voltage because of wired voltage tester. So, for such situations we can use a Mains Voltage Detector.

As the name suggests, this circuit detects if there is voltage flow or not through the live wire without any contact.
