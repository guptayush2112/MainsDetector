NOTE: This is a simulation based Electronics Project used to immitate a real world hardware implementation of the same.

As the name suggests, this circuit detects if there is voltage flow or not through the mains wire without making any physical contact with it. 

INSTRUCTIONS to view the project correctly:
1) Download the Github Repository as a .zip file.

2) Extract, then open and read the Instructions_MustRead.txt file.

3) Simultaneously, open the Mains Detector.asc using LTspice Software[Download Link--> https://ltspice.analog.com/software/LTspiceXVII.exe

3) After opening circuit--

  a. The circuit can be seen along with clear details and component specifications.

  b. Kindly follow the instructions_MustRead.txt file for successful simulations. You can also directly see the circuit simulation in the Simulation Results.jpg file that I have added.

3) For your reference and as a screenshot proof that the circuit is correct & working, I have added the Simulation Results.jpg screenshot to show the required successful simualations.
